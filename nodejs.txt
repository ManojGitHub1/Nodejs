npm init to initialize package.json
npm i (package_name) to install package
npm uninstall (package_name) to uninstall package
1. after installing package it will be in node_modules and
dependencies will be in package.json with version of package
2. if we give this to other person just run npm i

package-lock.json (can delete this file)
keeps the details of exact version of packages used in project

node_modules is a directory where all packages are stored
it is not a good practice to push this to repository
therefore it is add in gitignore
if this folder gets deleted then we can install packages again using npm i
details of these packages are in package.json

install nodemon using npm i nodemon
npm i nodemon -g to install globally
